# Interlocutor Installation and Operator Manual
## Human Radio Interface for Opulent Voice

### Overview

**Interlocutor** is the human-radio interface component of the Open Research Institute's Opulent Voice digital communication system. Think of it as the "radio console" that transforms your computing device (such as  Raspberry Pi or a laptop) into a sophisticated digital voice and data terminal. While traditional amateur radio digital modes often sacrifice audio quality for bandwidth efficiency, Interlocutor enables very high-quality voice communications with seamless integration of keyboard chat, file transfer, and system control messages.

**What Interlocutor Does:**
- Provides high-quality digital voice communication using OPUS codec
- Enables keyboard chat that integrates seamlessly with voice
- Handles file transfer and system control messages
- Offers both command-line and web-based interfaces
- Manages audio devices with sophisticated conflict resolution
- Implements priority-based message queuing (voice always wins)

**System Architecture:**
Interlocutor acts as the bridge between human operators and radio equipment. It processes voice, text, and data into properly formatted frames that can be sent to any Opulent Voice-compatible modem via Ethernet, enabling remote operation and modular system design.

# Raspberry Pi Installation

## Hardware Requirements

### Minimum Requirements
- **Raspberry Pi 4 or 5** (recommended: Pi 5 for best performance)
- **8GB+ microSD card** (Class 10 or better)
- **USB audio device** (headset or separate microphone/speakers)
- **Ethernet connection** (for connecting to radio equipment)

### Recommended Setup
- **USB headset with microphone** (dedicated for radio use)
- **HDMI output** (for browser audio, avoiding device conflicts)
- **GPIO PTT button** (momentary switch for push-to-talk control)
- **LED indicator** (for clear visual feedback on transmission status)

### Audio Device Strategy
Think of audio device management like managing multiple receivers in a traditional radio shack. The key principle: **one application per audio device**.

**Best Configuration (No Conflicts):**
- Radio (Interlocutor): USB headset/microphone
- Browser/System: HDMI output to monitor/TV speakers
- Result: Both can work simultaneously, depending on browser and operating system

**Alternative Hardware Solutions:**
- Two USB audio devices (one for radio, one for computer)
- USB hub with multiple audio interfaces
- 3.5mm splitter to share single headset between devices

There is audio device listing and audio device selection support in Interlocutor. Both the microphone and speaker are tested during the selection process. Audio device selection is saved to a local file called `audio_config.yaml`

```

### Step 2: Configure Python Environment

Add pyenv to your shell configuration:

```bash
sudo nano ~/.bashrc
```

Add these lines to the end of `.bashrc`:

```bash
# add pyenv to .bashrc
# this lets terminal know where to look for the pyenv
# versions of Python that we will be using. 
export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"
export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"
eval "$(pyenv init -)"
eval "$(pyenv virtualenv-init -)"
```

Reload your shell:

```bash
exec $SHELL
```

### Step 3: Install Python Dependencies for pyenv

Install the recommended build dependencies:

```bash
sudo apt-get install --yes libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev llvm libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev xz-utils tk-dev libgdbm-dev lzma lzma-dev tcl-dev libxml2-dev libxmlsec1-dev libffi-dev liblzma-dev wget curl make build-essential openssl
```

### Step 4: Install Audio System Dependencies

```bash
sudo apt install python3-pyaudio build-essential portaudio19-dev python3-dev
```

### Step 5: Clone and Setup Interlocutor

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/OpenResearchInstitute/interlocutor
cd interlocutor

# Install and activate Python 3.11.2 (or the version of your choice) in a virtual environment
pyenv update
pyenv install 3.11.2
pyenv virtualenv 3.11.2 your_environment_name
pyenv activate your_environment_name

# Install Python packages
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

There may be other Python packages required for your system. requirements.txt will be as updated as possible, but watch for any missing modules and install them. 

```

## Audio Device Configuration

### Understanding Audio Device Management

Just like a multi-radio station where each radio needs its own antenna connection, each application needs exclusive access to its audio device. Interlocutor includes sophisticated tools to help you manage this.

### Audio Setup Commands

```bash
# Show all available audio devices
python3 interlocutor.py YOUR_CALLSIGN --list-audio

# Interactive audio device selection
python3 interlocutor.py YOUR_CALLSIGN --setup-audio

# Test current audio configuration
python3 interlocutor.py YOUR_CALLSIGN --test-audio
```

### Audio Device Selection Guide

**Device Priority Recommendations:**
1. **USB devices** (better isolation, dedicated for radio use)
2. **Built-in devices** (adequate for testing, may have conflicts)

**Visual Device Discovery Features:**
- Clear indicators showing USB vs built-in devices
- Live microphone level meters during testing
- Speaker test tones with user confirmation
- Smart recommendations based on device type

**Device Testing Process:**
1. Select input device and see real-time level meters
2. Test output device with confirmation tones
3. Save preferences for future sessions
4. Quick re-selection without restarting

## Protocol and Network Configuration

### Understanding Opulent Voice Protocol

Interlocutor implements the Opulent Voice protocol with sophisticated frame management:

**Frame Types and Priorities:**
1. **VOICE** (Priority 1): OPUS-encoded audio, immediate transmission
2. **CONTROL** (Priority 2): PTT state changes, high priority queue, A5 messages
3. **TEXT** (Priority 3): Keyboard chat, normal priority queue
4. **DATA** (Priority 4): File transfers, low priority queue

**Network Ports:**
- **57372**: Network Transmitter port (configurable, connects to SDR/repeater)
- **57373**: Audio frames
- **57374**: Text frames  
- **57375**: Control frames

### Frame Structure

All frames follow the Opulent Voice protocol format:
- **Header**: 14 bytes (sync word + station ID + type + sequence + length + reserved)
- **Payload**: Variable length data loaded up in 40 ms frames
- **Encoding**: COBS (Consistent Overhead Byte Stuffing) framing
- **Transport**: UDP over IP with RTP headers for audio, UDP over IP for control, text, and data

### Network Integration

```bash
# Basic operation (connects to default target with default values)
python3 interlocutor.py YOUR_CALLSIGN

# Specify target IP and port
python3 interlocutor.py YOUR_CALLSIGN --target-ip 192.168.1.100 --target-port 57372

# Load specific configuration
python3 interlocutor.py YOUR_CALLSIGN -c mystation.yaml
```

## Audio System Operation

### Voice Communication

**Push-to-Talk (PTT) Operation:**
- **GPIO Button**: Physical button connected to Raspberry Pi GPIO
- **Web PTT**: Additional click/touch controls in web interface

**Audio Processing Pipeline:**
1. Microphone input â†’ PyAudio capture
2. Audio validation and level checking
3. OPUS encoding (40ms frames, 16,000 bps bitrate)
4. RTP header addition
5. UDP header addition
6. IP header addition
7. COBS encoding
8. Opulent Voice header addition
9. Network transmission

**Quality Settings:**
- Default: 16kbps OPUS encoding (path to 32kbps in future version)
- Frame size: 40ms (optimized for real-time performance)

### Chat Integration

**Message Priority Logic:**
- Voice transmission has absolute priority
- Text messages typed during PTT are buffered
- Buffered messages transmit immediately when PTT releases
- Control messages maintain high priority for system functions

**Chat Modes:**
- **Voice + Chat**: Normal operation with seamless integration
- **Chat Only**: Keyboard-to-keyboard communication (similar to RTTY)
- **Mixed Mode**: Operators can choose voice or text as appropriate
